# Music File Placement

Place your `BlobGardenSoundtrack.mp3` file in the root directory of the project, alongside the other game files:

```
/
├── index.html
├── game_working.js
├── styles.css
├── BlobGardenSoundtrack.mp3  ← Place your music file here
├── blobgardenlogo.png
├── garden_background.png
├── rock.png
└── *blob.png files
```

The game will automatically load and play the background music when it starts, with the music enabled by default.

## Audio Controls

The game now has two separate audio controls in the top-right corner:

- 🎵 Music toggle (background soundtrack)
- 🔊 Sound effects toggle (button clicks, coin sounds, blob interactions)

Both controls save their state to localStorage and will remember the user's preferences between sessions.
